* Install
** Homebrew
#+begin_src sh
  brew tap xenodium/macosrec
  brew install macosrec
#+end_src
** Build
#+begin_src sh
  swift build
#+end_src
* Screenshot

Before taking a screenshot, identify the window number using =--list=.

#+begin_src sh
  $ macosrec --list

  21902 Emacs
  22024 Dock - Desktop Picture - Stone.png
  22035 Firefox - Planet Emacslife
#+end_src

Use =--screenshot= + window number to take a screenshot.

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --screenshot 21902
  ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.png
#+end_src

* Videos

Before taking a video, identify the window number using =--list=.

#+begin_src sh
  $ macosrec --list

  21902 Emacs
  22024 Dock - Desktop Picture - Stone.png
  22035 Firefox - Planet Emacslife
#+end_src

Use =--record= + window number to start recording a video (gif).

/Note: you can also use application name and it will use the first window it finds belonging to it./

To end recording, send a SIGINT signal (Ctrl+C from terminal). Alternatively, running =macosrec --save= from another session would also end the recording.

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --record 21902 --gif
  Saving...
  ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.gif
#+end_src

/Note: you can also use application name and it will use the first window it finds belonging to it./

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --record emacs --mov
  Saving...
  ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.mov
#+end_src

** Optimizing gif

The gifs can get pretty large fairly quickly depending on the lenght of the recording. Consider using something like [[https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/][gifsicle]] to reduce size. For example:

#+begin_src sh
  gifsicle -O3 large.gif --lossy=80 -o smaller.gif
#+end_src

* Disclaimer

I built this util to record demos I post at [[https://xenodium.com][xenodium.com]]. Does the job so far, but can likely take improvements, specially around image handling efficiency. PRs totally welcome.

** Resizing windows while recording (not supported)

While a video will be recorded if you resize the window during the recording session, it's unlikely to produce a file with the expected outcome. This feature is currently unsupported and out of scope. Having said that, if anyone's keen to implement it, a PR is totally welcome.
